# SPICA
Spectral Calculations for SPICA observations of the Giant Planets and Titan

This is a repository for giant planet spectral simulations for the ESA/JAXA SPICA mission, currently being evaluated as ESA's M5 mission.  Text files contain forward-modelled simulations of the four giant planets using the SPICA SMI instrument modes, please see the PowerPoint presentation for further details.
